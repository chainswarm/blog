We're excited to launch the Chain Insights Blog. This is where we'll be sharing everything about our journey building the **Chain Insights Agent ($CIA)** — from high-level architecture decisions to the nitty-gritty details of on-chain data analysis.

## What to Expect

Here's what you'll find on this blog:

- **Architecture Deep Dives** — Detailed breakdowns of how our pipeline works, from indexers to ML models to the agent framework.
- **Progress Updates** — Regular updates on what we've shipped, what we're working on, and what's coming next.
- **Technical Challenges** — Honest write-ups about the problems we've hit and how we solved (or worked around) them.
- **Ecosystem Insights** — Our perspective on the broader blockchain analytics landscape and where we see things heading.

## Why a Blog?

We believe the best projects are built in the open. Writing about what we're doing forces us to think clearly about our decisions, and sharing our work helps the broader community learn from our experience.

Every post here represents something we've actually built, broken, or learned. No theoretical fluff — just real engineering from the trenches.
