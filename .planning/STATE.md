## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure (Foundation -> Content Polish -> Interactions & Experience) derived from requirement dependencies
- [Research]: No new dependencies needed — all polish achievable via Tailwind v4 CSS features
- [Research]: Gold overload is primary risk — reserve gold for interactive elements, use cream for headings/body
- [Phase 1]: SPAC-01 uses py-12 sm:py-20 (not py-16 sm:py-24 from requirements) — deliberate mobile-friendly sizing to prevent hero consuming viewport
- [Phase 1]: --color-dark-elevated token defined but not applied in Phase 1 — reserved for Phase 3 card hover states
- [Phase 1]: PROS-04 partially addressed in Phase 1 (prose var() refs) — remaining prose styling in Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Background color #0A0A0F may cause halation on OLED — test during visual review
- [Resolved]: Font choice settled on Inter — loaded and working
