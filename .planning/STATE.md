## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure (Foundation -> Content Polish -> Interactions & Experience) derived from requirement dependencies
- [Research]: No new dependencies needed — all polish achievable via Tailwind v4 CSS features
- [Research]: Gold overload is primary risk — reserve gold for interactive elements, use cream for headings/body

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Background color #0A0A0F may cause halation on OLED — test during Phase 1 and consider raising to #111118
- [Research]: Font choice (Inter vs Geist Sans) is a branding decision — validate during Phase 1 with actual content
