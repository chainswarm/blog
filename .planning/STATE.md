## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure (Foundation -> Content Polish -> Interactions & Experience)
- [Research]: No new dependencies needed — all polish achievable via Tailwind v4 CSS features
- [Research]: Gold overload is primary risk — reserve gold for interactive elements, use cream for headings/body
- [Phase 1]: --color-dark-elevated token defined but not applied — reserved for Phase 3 card hover states
- [Phase 2]: Blockquote background uses color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-gold) 5%, transparent) — subtle warm tint
- [Phase 2]: Gradient dividers at via-gold/20 — may need tuning to via-gold/30 if too subtle visually
- [Phase 2]: Inline code uses dark-surface background (not dark-elevated, reserved for Phase 3)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Background color #0A0A0F may cause halation on OLED — test during visual review
- [Resolved]: Font choice settled on Inter — loaded and working
- [Resolved]: PROS-04 fully satisfied — zero hardcoded hex in prose rules
