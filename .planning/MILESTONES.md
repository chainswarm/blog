# Project Milestones: Chain Insights Blog

## v1.0 Visual Polish (Shipped: 2026-02-06)

**Delivered:** Transformed the Chain Insights blog from functional MVP to a premium dark-themed experience with polished typography, refined prose styling, hover micro-interactions, ambient hero glow, and mobile responsiveness — all achieved through CSS/Tailwind refinement with zero new dependencies.

- Card hover micro-interactions with translateY lift, compound gold glow shadow, and coordinated 200ms transition timing across all interactive elements
- Barely perceptible hero radial gold glow (opacity 0.07) creating ambient warmth without visual noise
- 250ms opacity page transitions between routes via Nuxt pageTransition config
- Full mobile responsiveness with 44px touch targets, proportional spacing, and scaled typography

**Stats:**

- 31 files created/modified
- 380 lines of Vue/CSS/TypeScript
