## v1 Requirements

### Typography

- [x] **TYPO-01**: Blog uses Inter font family loaded via Google Fonts with proper font-display and subsetting
- [x] **TYPO-02**: Headings use tighter letter-spacing (tracking-tight) and deliberate size scale with clear hierarchy
- [x] **TYPO-03**: Body text uses relaxed line-height (1.6-1.75) for comfortable dark-mode reading
- [x] **TYPO-04**: Font weights limited to 3 (400 regular, 500 medium, 700 bold) for clean hierarchy

### Spacing

- [x] **SPAC-01**: Hero section uses generous vertical padding (py-12 sm:py-20) creating visual breathing room
- [x] **SPAC-02**: Post card list uses increased gaps (space-y-8 or greater) between cards
- [x] **SPAC-03**: Prose content has expanded margins between elements for comfortable reading
- [x] **SPAC-04**: Cards have increased internal padding for spacious feel

### Surface & Color

- [x] **SURF-01**: Three distinct surface elevation levels used consistently (dark base, surface, elevated)
- [x] **SURF-02**: Cards use surface background color instead of sitting flat on base
- [x] **SURF-03**: Gold accent usage is restrained — not every element uses gold (prevent gaudy overload)

### Card Interactions

- [x] **CARD-01**: Post cards have hover micro-interaction: subtle translateY lift + shadow emergence
- [x] **CARD-02**: Card border transitions to soft gold glow on hover (not hard gold border)
- [x] **CARD-03**: Tag badges have subtle gold glow effect on hover

### Dividers & Borders

- [x] **DIVD-01**: Section dividers use horizontal gradient fade (transparent to gold/20 to transparent) instead of hard borders
- [x] **DIVD-02**: Footer and header borders replaced with gradient fade dividers

### Prose Styling

- [x] **PROS-01**: Blockquotes styled with gold left border, subtle background tint, and refined typography
- [x] **PROS-02**: Images in posts have subtle border treatment and proper rounded corners
- [x] **PROS-03**: Prose links have refined underline style with smooth hover transitions
- [x] **PROS-04**: Prose CSS variables reference theme tokens (var()) instead of hardcoded hex values

### Code Blocks

- [x] **CODE-01**: Code blocks have refined border, padding, and border-radius treatment
- [x] **CODE-02**: Code block styling harmonizes with gold/cream palette

### Transitions

- [x] **TRNS-01**: All interactive elements have consistent transition timing (150-200ms ease-out)
- [x] **TRNS-02**: Nav links, footer links, and tag badges all use coordinated hover transitions
- [x] **TRNS-03**: Page transitions use subtle opacity fade between routes (200-300ms)

### Hero & Ambient

- [x] **HERO-01**: Hero section has subtle radial gradient glow using gold at very low opacity behind heading
- [x] **HERO-02**: Glow effect is barely perceptible — felt, not seen (opacity 0.05-0.10 range)

### Responsive

- [x] **RESP-01**: All interactive elements have minimum 44px touch targets on mobile
- [x] **RESP-02**: Typography scale adjusts appropriately for mobile screens
- [x] **RESP-03**: Spacing reduces proportionally on mobile while maintaining breathing room
- [x] **RESP-04**: Header navigation works cleanly on mobile viewports
