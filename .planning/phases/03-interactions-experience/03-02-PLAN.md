# Plan 03-02: Hero Ambient Glow and Page Transitions

## Goal

Add a barely perceptible radial gold glow behind the hero heading that creates ambient presence without drawing attention. Configure Nuxt page transitions so route changes have a subtle opacity fade.

## Requirements

- **HERO-01**: Hero section has subtle radial gradient glow using gold at very low opacity behind heading
- **HERO-02**: Glow effect is barely perceptible -- felt, not seen (opacity 0.05-0.10 range)
- **TRNS-03**: Page transitions use subtle opacity fade between routes (200-300ms)

## Changes

### File: `app/pages/index.vue`

**Add a radial gradient glow element behind the hero heading.** The hero `<section>` needs to become a positioning context with a glow element inside.

Current hero section:

```html
<section class="py-12 sm:py-20">
  <h1 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gold">Chain Insights Blog</h1>
  <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-cream-muted max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">
    Project progress, architecture insights, and lessons learned as we build
    the Chain Insights Agent ($CIA).
  </p>
</section>
```

Replace with:

```html
<section class="relative py-12 sm:py-20">
  <div
    class="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-[600px] h-[300px] opacity-[0.07] blur-[40px] pointer-events-none"
    style="background: radial-gradient(ellipse at center, var(--color-gold), transparent 70%)"
    aria-hidden="true"
  ></div>
  <h1 class="relative text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gold">Chain Insights Blog</h1>
  <p class="relative mt-4 text-lg text-cream-muted max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">
    Project progress, architecture insights, and lessons learned as we build
    the Chain Insights Agent ($CIA).
  </p>
</section>
```

Key details:
- The `<section>` gets `relative` for positioning context
- New `<div>` is absolutely positioned, centered behind the heading area
- `w-[600px] h-[300px]` gives a wide elliptical shape
- `opacity-[0.07]` is in the 0.05-0.10 sweet spot -- barely perceptible
- `blur-[40px]` makes the edges extremely soft and diffused
- `pointer-events-none` so it doesn't interfere with clicks
- `aria-hidden="true"` for accessibility (decorative element)
- `radial-gradient(ellipse at center, var(--color-gold), transparent 70%)` creates a gold center that fades to nothing
- The `<h1>` and `<p>` get `relative` so they render above the glow

### File: `nuxt.config.ts`

**Add `pageTransition` config inside the `app` key.** Insert after the existing `head` property:

```ts
app: {
  baseURL: '/blog/',
  head: { /* existing */ },
  pageTransition: {
    name: 'page',
    mode: 'out-in',
  },
},
```

The `name: 'page'` maps to CSS class prefix `.page-enter-active`, `.page-leave-active`, etc. The `mode: 'out-in'` ensures the old page fades out before the new one fades in (prevents layout overlap).

### File: `app/assets/css/main.css`

**Add page transition CSS classes at the end of the file** (after the scrollbar styles, before the final closing). These classes are what Nuxt's `pageTransition` config looks for:

```css
/* Page transitions */
.page-enter-active,
.page-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 250ms var(--ease-smooth);
}

.page-enter-from,
.page-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Key details:
- 250ms is in the 200-300ms range specified by TRNS-03
- Uses the existing `--ease-smooth` token for consistency
- Simple opacity fade -- no transform or other properties to keep it subtle

**IMPORTANT: This change only adds NEW lines at the end of main.css. It does NOT modify the `@theme` block (that is Plan 03-01's responsibility). These two plans touch different sections of main.css and can run in parallel without conflict.**

## Verification

1. **Build check**: Run `npx nuxi build` -- must complete without errors
2. **Hero glow element**: Grep `index.vue` for `radial-gradient` -- must exist
3. **Hero glow opacity**: Grep `index.vue` for `opacity-[0.07]` -- must exist (in the 0.05-0.10 range)
4. **Hero glow non-interactive**: Grep `index.vue` for `pointer-events-none` and `aria-hidden` -- both must exist on glow div
5. **Page transition config**: Grep `nuxt.config.ts` for `pageTransition` -- must exist with `name: 'page'` and `mode: 'out-in'`
6. **Transition CSS**: Grep `main.css` for `page-enter-active` and `page-leave-active` -- both must exist
7. **Transition timing**: The CSS must contain `250ms` (or a value in the 200-300ms range)
8. **No @theme modification**: The `@theme` block in `main.css` must NOT be modified by this plan (Plan 03-01 handles that)
