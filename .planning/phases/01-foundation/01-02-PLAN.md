<objective>
Apply the design tokens from Plan 01 to all Vue templates: update the hero section with generous spacing, increase card gaps and internal padding, add surface elevation to cards, implement the typography hierarchy (tight tracking on headings, relaxed line-height on body), and ensure gold restraint in templates (page h1 stays gold as focal point, all other text uses cream/cream-muted).

Purpose: This transforms the visual feel from cramped MVP to spacious premium. The tokens exist — now they need to be applied.
Output: Updated Vue templates with premium spacing, typography, and surface elevation.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update index.vue hero spacing and card list gaps</name>
  <files>app/pages/index.vue</files>
  <action>
Update the home page template with generous spacing:

1. Hero section: Change `py-8 sm:py-12` to `py-12 sm:py-20` for generous vertical breathing room (SPAC-01). Use responsive values so mobile gets reasonable padding without the hero consuming the full viewport (see research pitfall #5).

2. Hero h1: Add `tracking-tight` for tighter letter-spacing on the heading (TYPO-02). Keep `text-gold` — the page h1 is the one gold heading per page as the focal point (per research open question #2). Result: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gold`. Note: add `lg:text-5xl` for a larger desktop heading size to strengthen the hierarchy.

3. Hero subtitle: Keep `text-lg text-cream-muted max-w-2xl leading-relaxed` as-is — already correct.

4. Post card list: Change `space-y-6` to `space-y-8` for more breathing room between cards (SPAC-02).

Do NOT change the script section — data fetching logic stays the same.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd /home/aph5nt/blog && npx nuxi build 2>&1 | tail -20` — build succeeds. Grep index.vue for "sm:py-20", "tracking-tight", "space-y-8", "lg:text-5xl" to confirm all spacing and typography changes applied.</verify>
  <done>Hero has generous responsive padding (py-12 sm:py-20). Heading has tight tracking and 3-step responsive size scale. Card list gaps are space-y-8.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update BlogPostCard with surface elevation, padding, and typography</name>
  <files>app/components/BlogPostCard.vue</files>
  <action>
Update the card component for surface elevation, spacing, and typography:

1. Card article: Add `bg-dark-surface` background to lift cards off the page background (SURF-02). Increase padding from `p-6` to `p-8` for spacious internal feel (SPAC-04). Keep existing border, rounded-lg, transition-colors, and hover:border-gold/50. Result: `bg-dark-surface border border-dark-border rounded-lg p-8 transition-colors hover:border-gold/50`

2. Card h2: Add `tracking-tight` for tighter letter-spacing (TYPO-02). Change spacing from `mt-2` to `mt-3` for a touch more room. Keep `text-xl font-semibold text-cream group-hover:text-gold transition-colors`. Result: `mt-3 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-cream group-hover:text-gold transition-colors`

3. Card description paragraph: Change `mt-2` to `mt-3` for slightly more breathing room. Keep `text-cream-muted leading-relaxed`.

4. Tag section: Keep `mt-4 flex flex-wrap gap-2` as-is.

Do NOT change the script section or props.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd /home/aph5nt/blog && npx nuxi build 2>&1 | tail -20` — build succeeds. Grep BlogPostCard.vue for "bg-dark-surface", "p-8", "tracking-tight" to confirm changes.</verify>
  <done>Cards have dark-surface background (visually lifted off page), p-8 internal padding, and tight-tracked headings.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update post page and layout for typography and spacing</name>
  <files>app/pages/post/[...slug].vue, app/layouts/default.vue</files>
  <action>
Update the post page template for premium typography and spacing:

**post/[...slug].vue:**

1. Article wrapper: Change `py-8` to `py-6` (the layout default.vue adds its own padding, avoid double-stacking).

2. Post header section: Change `mt-6 mb-8` to `mt-8 mb-12` for more generous spacing between the back link and content (SPAC-03).

3. Post h1: Add `tracking-tight` for tighter letter-spacing (TYPO-02). Add `lg:text-5xl` for larger desktop size. Keep `text-gold` — this is the page focal point. Result: `mt-3 text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gold`

4. Post description: Change `mt-3` to `mt-4`. Keep `text-lg text-cream-muted`.

5. Prose container: Keep `prose prose-lg max-w-none` — the prose plugin with our updated overrides (from Plan 01) handles body text line-height. The `prose-lg` class provides the 1.6-1.75 line-height range needed for comfortable reading (TYPO-03).

**default.vue:**

1. Main element: Change `py-8` to `py-6 sm:py-8` to make the layout padding responsive and avoid excessive stacking with page-level padding on mobile.

Do NOT change script sections or data fetching logic in either file.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd /home/aph5nt/blog && npx nuxi build 2>&1 | tail -20` — build succeeds. Grep post/[...slug].vue for "tracking-tight", "lg:text-5xl", "mb-12". Grep default.vue for "py-6 sm:py-8".</verify>
  <done>Post page has generous header spacing (mt-8 mb-12), tight-tracked bold heading with responsive sizes, and prose-lg for comfortable reading. Layout padding is responsive.</done>
</task>

1. `cd /home/aph5nt/blog && npx nuxi build` completes without errors
2. index.vue hero section uses py-12 sm:py-20 (generous responsive padding)
3. index.vue card list uses space-y-8 (increased gaps)
4. BlogPostCard.vue has bg-dark-surface (surface elevation) and p-8 (spacious padding)
5. Both page h1 headings (index + post) have tracking-tight
6. Both page h1 headings (index + post) have responsive size scale including lg:text-5xl
7. Both page h1 headings (index + post) remain text-gold (focal point exception)
8. Card h2 headings and all body text use cream/cream-muted (not gold)
9. Post header has generous spacing (mt-8 mb-12)
10. Layout uses responsive padding (py-6 sm:py-8)

<success_criteria>
- Hero section feels spacious with generous vertical padding, not cramped
- Post cards are visually lifted off the page background (surface elevation visible)
- Clear heading size hierarchy: h1 (3xl-5xl bold tight) > h2 (xl semibold tight) > body (base relaxed)
- Font weights limited to 400 (body), 500 (medium/description), 700 (bold/headings) per TYPO-04
- Gold usage in templates: ONLY on page h1 titles and hover states. All other text is cream/cream-muted per SURF-03
- Spacing feels generous throughout: hero, card gaps, card internal padding, post header margins
</success_criteria>
